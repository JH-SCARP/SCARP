##SCARP Analysis Files 


This repository provides the code for the development and validation of SCARP. 

The code is organized into the predictions for the 1-day and 1-week risk for progression to severe illness or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 

For each folder, there are three separate R scripts: 1) overall analysis, 2) hospital-site cross-validation, and 3) temporal validation.
